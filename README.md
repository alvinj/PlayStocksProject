# Play Framework "Anorm" CRUD Examples

This project contains a collection of Play Framework Anorm
"CRUD" (create, read, update, delete) examples.

The example is documented in my "Play Framework Recipes" booklet
(which was spawned from the Scala Cookbook). You can download the
Play Framework Recipes from this URL:
